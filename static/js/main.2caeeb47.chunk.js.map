classroom, I find that personal growth and moral inquiry are often inadvertently regarded as separate dispositions at Columbia. When in class, we maintain that to shape and alter society is to scribble down a thought and raise our hands. Yet upon leaving the classroom, it seems that for many, notions of change and the responsibility to act recoil inward. </p><p>\n\n                        Are discussions on justice, equality, race, or class only of “worth” when they lead to a Columbia degree or are the impassioned arguments I’ve heard in class catalyzed by something more? </p><p>\n\n                        In the wake of the death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, I am skeptical about how long this persistent hum of morals being released from their restraints will continue. However, while it lasts, I encourage the exploration of this phenomena—internal morality’s exposure to the outside world. I fundamentally believe that personal growth and moral inquiry are, in effect, the same thing.  </p><p>\n\n                        In your pursuit of morality and personal growth, I urge you to read through some of the experiences of and injustices suffered by the Black community at the hands of students and Columbia itself over the past four years. The purpose of this scope is to promote sustained action, so I also implore you to treat it as more than a class reading and aim to deeply engage with it.
